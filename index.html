                    <p>My group created an application that lets users know which streaming platforms their searched movies and shows are on. There are direct links to the streaming platforms from the results page, as well as information about the searched movie/show, suggested similar titles, and the ability to store your liked movie/show in a list for easier access at a later time. I lead the javascript portion of this project, where I learned more & more quickly than I thought possible. This was an amazing learning experience and has taught me a lot!</p>

                    <p>This is an application that allows users to look up the weather in any city. The application saves their search history to a list so that they can easily access previously searched cities. Upon inputting a city's name, the user is provided the current weather, as well as the 5-day forecast, to allow allow for trip & activity planning. They are given information on the date, an icon representing the weather, the temperature, wind speed, and humidity for each day. This weather app uses the following API to fetch its data: https://openweathermap.org/forecast5</p>

                    <summary>2nd Group Project</summary>
                    <p>This application is a platform for past and present bootcamp students to connect, ask questions, mentor, and network with others going through the same experience. Unlike some other forums, even ones specifically for software development, this application is exclusively* for students in coding bootcamp programs, allowing users to have a much more personalized experience.

                        A key benefit to having this large, yet personalized application, is that if students are stuck on a weekly challenge or project, they can search by category to find a post with relevant information to their problem; if they don't see a solution already listed, they can create a post, specify the category and have a member from the community help them out. Having this information available to other users (rather than just in a direct message) will help future students who also face the same question. We envision these categories will not only include various coding languages, libraries, and projects, but also interview tips, job postings, & updates from within the coding community.
                        
                        This application uses Node.js and a MySQL database, which is hosted & deployed on Heroku.
                        
                        *Employers can also create profiles to find excellent job candidates, list job/internship postings, etc.</p>

                    <p>This is a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each working hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML & CSS powered by jQuery. It uses the Day.js library to provide udpated date & time, which helps to show the user their current & upcoming events using colour-coordinated time blocks based on whether the time is in the past, present or future.
